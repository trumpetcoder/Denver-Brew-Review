Denver-Brew-Review
The Denver-Brew-Review is a project near and dear to my heart. As many people in my life know, I have a love for craft beer. I have worked in the brewing field, met my life long companion working in a brew-pub, and can be found relaxing in one of the many local breweries usually winning trivia.

When trying to find new breweries to visit or remembering what my impressions are of past breweries I've been to, I have not found a reliable way to record my impressions and thoughts. I want to quickly and efficiently look at my impressions of atmosphere, beer selection, staff, pricing, etc.

Sure, one can simply use notes on their phone. But our note files are filled with a jumble of varying material that is not centered around one particular thing. Enter the Denver-Brew-Review, the Yelp centered around breweries and beer bars.

The Denver-Brew-Review is a mobile responsive designed program that allows the user to record their impressions of the places they visit so that they can later be reminded of what they liked or didn't about a particular place. The user will be able to create, edit, delete, get, and update their experiences at a particular brewery. In addition, users will be able to read other reviews submitted by fellow users of the Denver-Brew-Review.

Through the use of Google Maps API, and the BreweryDB.com API, users will be able to search for breweries and bars that are located near them. This can be cross referenced with reviews that already exist so users can read a little about the places in their area. They can add to reviews, so that other users can read their impressions.

Third Party API's used:
Google Maps API (Users can drop pins of visited breweries)
BreweryDB API (For Information regarding particular breweries)
