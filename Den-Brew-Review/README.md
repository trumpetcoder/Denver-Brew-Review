<h1>Denver Brew Review</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
The Denver-Brew-Review is a project I am personally passionate about, bringing together my love of craft beer and learning new technologies in my advancement in web development. The basis of the project stems from the ability to keep track of, and review breweries in the Denver metro area so that in the future I can be reminded of what I liked or disliked about a particular place. 

With this passion in place, and my eyes firmly planted on my future in web development, I decided to build an application that can enter reviews and mark on a map of places I had visited. This is not only useful in remembering my impressions of local establishments, but also gives me the opportunity to learn new and exciting web technologies that I can leverage into future employment. 

When starting, I wanted to be able to gain inspiration from sources regarding what I could reasonably emulate in a short time frame of 5 days. There are four current sites that I have taken inspiration from to help guide my way in development. Denver-Brew-Review is not meant to emulate these sites. Only to gain inspiration and focus on a desired end of learning new technology in a functional setting.

<h2>Goals set forth by the instructional staff</h2>

<h3>Technical Requirements</h3>
Your app must:

Be a full-stack application
Consume and/or serve an API
Have an interactive front-end, preferably using a modern front-end framework
Be a complete product, which most likely means multiple relationships and CRUD functionality for at least a couple models
Use a database, whether that's one we've covered in class or one you want to learn
Implement thoughtful user stories that are significant enough to help you know which features to build and which to scrap
Have a visually impressive design to kick your portfolio up a notch and have something to wow future clients & employers
Be deployed online so it's publicly accessible

<h3>Necessary Deliverables</h3>

A working API, hosted somewhere on the internet
A working front-end, hosted somewhere on the internet
A link to your hosted working app in the URL section of your Github repo
A git repository hosted on Github, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
A readme.md file with:
An embedded screenshot of the app
Explanations of the technologies used
A couple paragraphs about the general approach you took
Installation instructions for any dependencies
Link to your user stories – who are your users, what do they want, and why?
Link to your wireframes – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
Descriptions of any unsolved problems or major hurdles you had to overcome

<h3>Mockup and User Flow</h3>

Denver-Brew-Review, by design, is a desktop application that a user can use to log reviews of breweries they have visited. It is comprised of a landing page that requires Login/Registration authentication, leading to a reviews forum and links to Google maps. Inside the reviews forum the user can Create, Update, Delete, See, and grab reviews of breweries thay and others have visited. The Google maps allows the User to see the location of breweries in the area.

Stretch goals:
Employ phone technology to add user photos to their accounts.
Have a chat room enabled for users that they can participate in.
Use of the App for meetups and in a social platform setting.
Reverse notification from breweries on release dates of new beers and events.
