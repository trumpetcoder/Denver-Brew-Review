<h1>Denver Brew Review</h1>

<h3>Description</h3>
The Denver-Brew-Review is a project I am personally passionate about, bringing together my love of craft beer and learning new technologies in my advancement in web development. The basis of the project stems from the ability to keep track of, and review breweries in the Denver metro area so that in the future I can be reminded of what I liked or disliked about a particular place. 

With this passion in place, and my eyes firmly planted on my future in web development, I decided to build an application that can enter reviews and mark on a map of places I had visited. This is not only useful in remembering my impressions of local establishments, but also gives me the opportunity to learn new and exciting web technologies that I can leverage into future employment. 

When starting this I wanted to be able to gain inspiration from sources as to what I could reasonably emulate in a short time frame of 5 days. There are four current sites that I have taken inspiration from to help guide my way in development. Denver-Brew-Review is not meant to emulate these sites. Only to gain inspiration and focus on a desired end.

<h3>Sites used as guides and inspiration:</h3>

<h3>Mockup and User Flow</h3>

Denver-Brew-Review, by design, is a desktop application that a user can use to log reviews of breweries they have visited. It is comprised of a landing page that requires Login/Registration authentication, leading to a reviews forum and links to Google maps. Inside the reviews forum the user can Create, Update, Delete, See, and grab reviews of breweries thay and others have visited. The Google maps allows the User to see the location of breweries in the area.
